            'theatre environment, AMC is recognized as an industry leader and '
            'an iconic destination. And it all started when the son of one of '
            'the original owners returned from serving in the army and took '
            'over a successful Midwestern family business.Stanley Durwood saw '
            'one screen in one building as limiting. People wanted more '
            'choices. So he began remodeling several large single-screen '
            'Kansas City, Mo. theatres into smaller buildings with multiple '
            'auditoriums. The result? The first multiplex theatre in the world '
            'was born. The success was massive, and the theatre served as a '
            'blueprint for the industry. By 1968, Durwood’s multi-screen '
            'theatre chain had expanded nationwide and was incorporated as '
            'American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (AMC).During the next three decades '
            'of Durwood’s leadership, AMC continued to innovate with the '
            'movie-goer in mind. The armchair cup holder, stadium seating and '
            'the industry’s first rewards program—AMC MovieWatcher '
            'Rewards—continued to revolutionize the cinema industry.In 2009, '
            'Gerardo “Gerry” Lopez became just the fourth CEO in AMC history. '
            'Guided by Lopez’s leadership, AMC continues to meet the '
            'ever-changing needs of moviegoers nationwide by keeping its focus '

            'digital projection, 3D movies and more large-screen formats like '
            'IMAX and AMC’s proprietary ETX experience. These are just a few '

            'latest and greatest ways to enjoy the movies., a leading '
            'privately-held entertainment conglomerate. And AMC continues to '

            'through the doors of its more than 300 locations. With innovative '
            'amenities and a focus on providing an array of movies in the best '
            'theatre environment, AMC is recognized as an industry leader and '
            'an iconic destination. And it all started when the son of one of '
            'the original owners returned from serving in the army and took '
            'over a successful Midwestern family business.Stanley Durwood saw '
            'one screen in one building as limiting. People wanted more '
            'choices. So he began remodeling several large single-screen '
            'Kansas City, Mo. theatres into smaller buildings with multiple '
            'auditoriums. The result? The first multiplex theatre in the world '
            'was born. The success was massive, and the theatre served as a '
            'blueprint for the industry. By 1968, Durwood’s multi-screen '
            'theatre chain had expanded nationwide and was incorporated as '
            'American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (AMC).During the next three decades '
            'of Durwood’s leadership, AMC continued to innovate with the '
            'movie-goer in mind. The armchair cup holder, stadium seating and '
            'the industry’s first rewards program—AMC MovieWatcher '
            'Rewards—continued to revolutionize the cinema industry.In 2009, '
            'Gerardo “Gerry” Lopez became just the fourth CEO in AMC history. '
            'Guided by Lopez’s leadership, AMC continues to meet the '
            'ever-changing needs of moviegoers nationwide by keeping its focus '
            'where it belongs: the guest.bars. The company is also constantly '
            'upgrading the movie presentation, including a conversion to '
            'digital projection, 3D movies and more large-screen formats like '
            'IMAX and AMC’s proprietary ETX experience. These are just a few '
            'of the latest ways AMC continues to invest in bringing guests the '
            'latest and greatest ways to enjoy the movies., a leading '
            'privately-held entertainment conglomerate. And AMC continues to '
            'embrace the vital principles of innovation and service that began '
            'back with the Durwood brothers in 1920. When guests choose AMC '
            'Theatres, it’s the goal of all associates to make every '

            'theatre environment, AMC is recognized as an industry leader and '
            'an iconic destination. And it all started when the son of one of '

            'over a successful Midwestern family business.Stanley Durwood saw '
            'one screen in one building as limiting. People wanted more '
            'choices. So he began remodeling several large single-screen '
            'Kansas City, Mo. theatres into smaller buildings with multiple '
            'auditoriums. The result? The first multiplex theatre in the world '
            'was born. The success was massive, and the theatre served as a '
            'blueprint for the industry. By 1968, Durwood’s multi-screen '
            'theatre chain had expanded nationwide and was incorporated as '
            'American Multi-Cinema, Inc. (AMC).During the next three decades '
            'of Durwood’s leadership, AMC continued to innovate with the '

            'the industry’s first rewards program—AMC MovieWatcher '
            'Rewards—continued to revolutionize the cinema industry.In 2009, '
            'Gerardo “Gerry” Lopez became just the fourth CEO in AMC history. '
            'Guided by Lopez’s leadership, AMC continues to meet the '
            'ever-changing needs of moviegoers nationwide by keeping its focus '
            'where it belongs: the guest.bars. The company is also constantly '
            'upgrading the movie presentation, including a conversion to '
            'digital projection, 3D movies and more large-screen formats like '
            'IMAX and AMC’s proprietary ETX experience. These are just a few '
